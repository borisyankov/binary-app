### Portfolio

Portfolio is a summary of active transactions/purchases. Statement is to all transactions just like portpolio is to active transactions. An active transaction or purchase is a trade that is still ongoing , not sold or expired. Example is a trade whose duration was set in days, minutes or hours, provided the duration is not exceeded and the trade is not sold in the market, the trade would remain valid thus available under porfolio.
