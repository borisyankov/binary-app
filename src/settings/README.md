* Personal Details - can be changed only by contacting Customer Support
* Personal Address - can be changed by editing the form. Available for Real Money Accounts only
* Security - Change Password - self explanatory. On change, current authentication token is invalid
* Security - Cashier Lock - an additional password, used to restrict to cashier
* Self Exclusion - self imposed limits to trading actions. Once set, can only be lowered and not increased via the form
* Limits - backend enforced global limits to trading activities


### Self Exclusion
* It should based on User id (eg. VRTC900000000), thus when one user id is being excluded, other user id that tied to the same user email should still be accessible
* VRTC cannot be self-excluded
